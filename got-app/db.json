Daenerys is one of the last members of the exiled House Targaryen. She is the only daughter of King Aerys II Targaryen and Queen Rhaella Targaryen, and the younger sister of Crown Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Viserys Targaryen. Born during the end of Robert's Rebellion, Daenerys was smuggled across the Narrow Sea with her brother, Viserys, to the Free City of Braavos. After Darry died of old age, the two were forced to flee from one city to another to avoid her King Robert I Baratheon's assassins. At some point of the story, Viserys made her his heir, and after his death, Daenerys inherits his claim to the Iron Throne and begins plotting to take it back from the people that forced her family out decades before as the 'rightful heir' of House Targaryen. She later becomes known as the 'Mother of Dragons', after she caused the hatching of three of the creatures."

Balon's two older sons were killed, and Theon was taken by Lord Eddard Stark as a hostage for Balon's good behavior and obedience. With Yara as Balon's only remaining child in the Iron Islands, he raised her as a surrogate son, encouraging her to become a reaver in her own right, which is unusual for women in the patriarchal culture of the Ironborn. She is a fierce warrior and commands her own longship, to the disquiet of some of the Ironborn who hold that women should not fight or command men in battle."

Following the failure of the Greyjoy Rebellion, Euron went into exile, and has spent the last years as a pirate, reaving from Oldtown to Qarth and beyond, fighting Summer Islanders and the Ibbenese. He once lost his senses during a storm while sailing on the Jade Sea, and his crew was forced to tie him to the mast to prevent him from jumping overboard. When he was let down after the storm, he had all their tongues ripped out. Euron later glibly remarked of the incident that \"I needed silence.\""

He remembers Aerys as a great man before his descent into madness. When Tywin Lannister marched to the gates of King's Landing, following the rebel victory at the Battle of the Trident, nearly all of the king's advisors told Aerys not to trust Tywin; Pycelle, however, gave the opposite counsel and the city gates were opened, allowing the Lannister forces to sack the capital. Following the rebellion, he remained Grand Maester to King Robert Baratheon. He played up his age to appear harmless, but was actually mentally sharp and dangerous. He was loyal to Queen Cersei Lannister (although she found him annoying and his loyalty troubling) and was involved in the birth of all of her children, assisted by midwives. He privately used to flout the vow of celibacy taken by maesters."

His nose was broken a second time at age 9, during a scrap with a few older boys and they won. It was also broken a third time, but the details are unknown. Bronn has also mentioned that he first found out that men void their bowels when they die when he was only 5 years old. When Tyrion Lannister introduced him to Tywin Lannister, Bronn said that his father is no one Lord Tywin would know. During a drinking game with Tyrion and Shae, Bronn claims that he killed a woman before he was 12 years old, though it was in self-defense as she was attacking him with an axe. Bronn also confirmed Tyrion's claim that Bronn has been beyond the Wall. When asked why he was there, he bluntly answers that it was work."
